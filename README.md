this is a simple app ceated by a group of four people for a hackathon coding competition.
use the features_add branch to make add anything to it.
i will add more branches for different purposes later on. 
UPDATE

After hours of consideration i have decided to drop it.Abandon it.Nobody is willing to help and it is too complicated for me to make.The repo will stay here.As a living memory of me and my teams attempt to make an app and do something in the competition.
